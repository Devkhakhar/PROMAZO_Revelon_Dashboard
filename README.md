# PROMAZO_Revelon_Dashboard
This project is a UX/UI design case study for a dashboard interface designed for Revlon's R&amp;D team. The dashboard allows the team to view and interact with optimization results for their product portfolio, focusing on user-friendly navigation, clear data visualization, and an intuitive interface.

Features

Dashboard Overview
Main Metrics Display:
The dashboard features interactive charts that display essential performance metrics, including Overall Sales, Gross Margin, and Growth.
These charts are created using Chart.js and provide hover-based tooltips for additional insights.
Dynamic Navigation
Navigation Panel:
A left-hand navigation panel enables users to switch between different views: Overall Portfolio, Product Categories, Time Periods, and Saved Views.
The title of the dashboard dynamically updates according to the selected view.
Save View Functionality
Save Current View:
Users can save the current state of the dashboard, including chart data, into the browser's local storage.
Future enhancements will allow users to display and manage these saved views.

HTML5: For structuring the content and layout of the dashboard.

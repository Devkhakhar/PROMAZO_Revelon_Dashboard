# PROMAZO_Revelon_Dashboard
This project is a UX/UI design case study for a dashboard interface designed for Revlon's R&amp;D team. The dashboard allows the team to view and interact with optimization results for their product portfolio, focusing on user-friendly navigation, clear data visualization, and an intuitive interface.


Features
Dashboard Overview:
Displays key performance metrics such as Overall Sales, Gross Margin, and Growth using interactive charts.
Navigation panel for switching between different views: Overall Portfolio, Product Categories, Time Periods, and Saved Views.
Dynamic Navigation:
The navigation panel allows users to switch between different dashboard views. Each view displays unique content relevant to the selected category.
The title of the dashboard dynamically updates based on the selected view.
Interactive Charts:
Implemented using Chart.js, the charts provide interactive features such as tooltips that display additional information when hovering over data points.
Save View Functionality:
Users can save the current state of the dashboard (e.g., data displayed in the charts) into the browser's local storage, allowing for easy reference in the future.
Technologies Used
HTML5 & CSS3: Structuring and styling the dashboard layout and user interface.
JavaScript (ES6): Handling interactive features, including chart generation, dynamic content switching, and saving views.
Chart.js: A JavaScript library used to create the interactive charts for visualizing key metrics.
